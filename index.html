                    Lata Mangeshkar was born on 28 September 1929 in a Gomantak Maratha Samaj family
                </li>
                <li>
                    When Mangeshkar was 13, her father died of heart disease. Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar
                    Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family,
                    took care of them. He helped Lata get started in a career as a singer and actress.

                <li>
                    Her first Hindi song was "Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya Badal De Tu" for the Marathi film, Gajaabhaau.
                </li>
                <li>
                    She moved to Mumbai in 1945 when Master Vinayak's company moved its headquarters there. She started
                    taking lessons in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After Vinayak's death, music director Ghulam Haider mentored her as a singer. He introduced
                    Mangeshkar to producer Sashadhar Mukherjee, who was working then on the movie Shaheed, but Mukherjee
                    dismissed Mangeshkar's voice as "too thin".An annoyed Haider responded that in coming years
                    producers and directors would "fall at Lata's feet" and "beg her" to sing in their movies. Haider
                    gave Lata her first major break with the song "Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chhora"—lyrics by
                    Nazim Panipati—from the movie Majboor, which became her first big breakthrough film hit.

                    At the age of 5, Lata started acting in her father’s musical plays-
                    Sangeet Natak in Marathi. She also played a minor role in the 1st
                    Hindi film by Master Vinayak- Bari Ma in 1945.
                    She got her 1st Filmfare Award for Best Playback Singer for the
                    song- Aaja Re Pardesi from the movie Madhumati in 1958. From 1958 to 1966, she monopolized Filmfare
                    awards for Best Female Playback Singer and it was stopped in 1969 only when she gave up the awards
                    in an unusual gesture for promoting fresh talents.

                    Kiti Hasaal in the year 1942, however, the song was dropped for some reasons
                    from the final cut. She sang her debut song in Marathi language- Natali
                    Chaitraachi Navalaai in the same year for the Marathi film- Pahili
                    Mangalaa-gaur.
